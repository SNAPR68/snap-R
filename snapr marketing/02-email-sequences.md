## Email 1: Welcome (Immediate)

**Subject Line Options:**
- Welcome to SnapR — let's edit your first listing
- Your SnapR account is ready 🎉
- 3 minutes to your first market-ready listing

**From:** Raj @ SnapR <raj@snapr.com>

**Body:**

```
Hey {{first_name}},

Welcome to SnapR! I'm Raj, the founder, and I'm genuinely excited you're here.

I built SnapR because I was tired of juggling 6 different tools just to market one listing. Photo editing in one app. Social posts in another. Videos somewhere else. Property websites on a different platform.

It was exhausting. And expensive.

So I built the platform I wished existed: everything in one place.

Here's how to get started in the next 3 minutes:

1. Upload your first photos (drag and drop)
2. Click "AI Enhance All" 
3. Watch the magic happen in ~30 seconds

That's it. Your photos are done.

Then explore Content Studio to create social posts, videos, and more — all from the same photos you just uploaded.

[BUTTON: Go to Dashboard →]

If you get stuck or have questions, just reply to this email. I read every message personally.

Let's make your listings look incredible.

— Raj

P.S. Your free trial includes unlimited photo enhancements for 14 days. No credit card required. No strings attached.

## Email 2: Feature Highlight (Day 1)

**Subject Line Options:**
- Did you try AI Enhance yet?
- The feature that saves 45 minutes per listing
- Quick tip: Enhance all photos at once

**Body:**

```
Hey {{first_name}},

Quick tip that'll save you serious time:

Instead of enhancing photos one by one, select all your photos and click "AI Enhance All."

SnapR will:
✓ Auto-correct exposure and color
✓ Replace blown-out skies
✓ Enhance HDR for interior shots
✓ Straighten verticals
✓ Remove minor distractions

All in about 30 seconds for 25 photos.

That's the same work that used to take 45+ minutes in Lightroom.

[BUTTON: Try AI Enhance →]

Here's a before/after from a user last week:

[IMAGE: Before/after comparison]

The quality speaks for itself.

Go try it on your next batch of photos.

— Raj
```

## Email 3: Content Studio (Day 3)

**Subject Line Options:**
- Your photos are edited. Now what?
- The feature most people miss
- From edited photos to social posts in 60 seconds

**Body:**

```
Hey {{first_name}},

So you've enhanced your photos. They look great.

Now what?

Most platforms stop here. You're left to figure out social media, videos, and marketing on your own.

Not SnapR.

Open Content Studio and you'll find:
• 150+ social media templates (Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn, TikTok)
• AI-powered caption generation
• One-click video creation
• Property website builder
• Email campaign templates

Here's the workflow that'll change your life:

1. Go to Content Studio
2. Pick a template (I like "Just Listed - Modern")
3. Watch as AI writes your caption
4. Hit "Create" 

60 seconds. Your social post is ready.

[BUTTON: Open Content Studio →]

This is the part that takes most agents 30-45 minutes per listing. We do it in under a minute.

Try creating one post right now. I promise you'll be hooked.

— Raj

P.S. The AI captions are surprisingly good. But you can always edit them if you want to add your personal touch.

## Email 4: Check-In (Day 5)

**Subject Line Options:**
- How's it going so far, {{first_name}}?
- Quick question about your experience
- Need any help?

**Body:**

```
Hey {{first_name}},

Just checking in — how's your SnapR experience so far?

I'd love to know:

→ Have you enhanced any photos yet?
→ Tried Content Studio?
→ Running into any issues?

If you're stuck on anything, just hit reply and tell me what's going on. I personally read every email and I'm happy to help.

And if you haven't had a chance to really dig in yet, no worries. Here's a quick 2-minute video showing the full workflow:

[VIDEO THUMBNAIL: "Full listing workflow in 2 minutes"]

Sometimes seeing it in action makes everything click.

P.S. If SnapR isn't right for you, I'd genuinely love to know why. Your feedback helps me build a better product for everyone.

## Email 5: Power User Tips (Day 7)

**Subject Line Options:**
- What our power users do differently
- 3 features you probably haven't tried
- Level up your SnapR workflow

**Body:**

```
Hey {{first_name}},

You're a week into your trial. Let me share what separates casual users from power users:

**1. Batch Everything**

Don't enhance one photo at a time. Upload your entire shoot, select all, enhance all. Same with content — create posts for multiple platforms in one session.

**2. Use AI Listing Intelligence**

Go to any listing and click "Analyze." The AI will:
- Score your photos
- Recommend your hero image
- Suggest which photos need work
- Flag any issues

It's like having a second pair of eyes on every listing.

**3. Save Your Templates**

Found a social post style you love? Save it as a template. Next time, one click and you're done. Same with email campaigns.

**4. Set Up Your Brand Kit**

Go to Settings → Brand Profile. Add your logo, colors, and headshot. Now every piece of content is automatically branded.

[BUTTON: Explore Advanced Features →]

These small optimizations add up. Power users save 3-4 hours per week compared to casual users.

— Raj
```

## Email 6: Urgency (Day 10)

**Subject Line Options:**
- Your trial is halfway done
- 4 days left to decide
- Don't lose your enhanced photos

**Body:**

```
Hey {{first_name}},

Quick heads up — your free trial is halfway done.

In the next 4 days, you might want to:

✓ Process any listings you've been sitting on
✓ Create content for your upcoming posts
✓ Test features you haven't tried yet

Because here's the thing: when your trial ends, you'll lose access to:
- All enhanced photos
- Saved templates
- Content you've created
- Your listing data

I don't want that for you.

If SnapR is working for you, now's the time to lock in your account:

**Pro Plan: $49/month**
- Unlimited photo enhancements
- All Content Studio features
- Property websites
- Email campaigns

**Agency Plan: $79/month**
- Everything in Pro
- Team collaboration
- Client approval system
- White-label options

[BUTTON: Upgrade & Keep Access →]

And if you're still not sure, reply and tell me what's holding you back. Maybe I can help.

— Raj

P.S. Annual plans get 2 months free. Just saying.
```

## Email 7: Final Day (Day 14)

**Subject Line Options:**
- Last day: Your SnapR trial ends tonight
- Final call, {{first_name}}
- Don't lose your work

**Body:**

```
Hey {{first_name}},

This is it — your SnapR trial ends at midnight tonight.

After that:
❌ No more photo enhancements
❌ No more Content Studio access
❌ Your saved work becomes inaccessible

I get it. Maybe the timing wasn't right. Maybe you didn't get a chance to really dig in.

But if there's even a part of you that sees how much time this could save...

Give yourself one more shot.

[BUTTON: Upgrade Now — $49/month →]

Still not sure? Here's what other users have said:

"SnapR cut my listing prep time from 3 hours to 15 minutes. I can't imagine going back." — Sarah M., RE Photographer

"I canceled Canva, Hootsuite, and two other subscriptions. SnapR does everything." — Mike T., Real Estate Agent

Your move.

— Raj

P.S. If you upgrade in the next 6 hours, I'll throw in a free 30-minute onboarding call with me personally. Just reply after you upgrade to claim it.

# SEQUENCE 2: NON-CONVERTER NURTURE
## For People Who Didn't Convert After Trial

---

## Email 1: No Pressure (Day 16)

**Subject Line:**
- No hard feelings
- Quick question before I stop emailing

**Body:**

```
Hey {{first_name}},

Your trial ended, and that's okay.

I'm not going to spam you with desperate "COME BACK" emails.

But I am curious: what happened?

Was it:
- Timing? (Didn't have a listing to test with)
- Price? (Let me know — I might be able to help)
- Features? (Missing something you needed)
- Quality? (Didn't meet expectations)
- Something else?

Just hit reply with a quick answer. One word is fine.

Your feedback genuinely helps me build a better product.

Either way, I'll keep you on our newsletter with occasional tips and updates. You can unsubscribe anytime.

Thanks for giving SnapR a shot.

— Raj

## Email 2: Case Study (Day 23)

**Subject Line:**
- How Sarah went from 3 hours to 15 minutes per listing

**Body:**

```
Hey {{first_name}},

Quick story I thought you'd find interesting:

Sarah was spending 3+ hours on every listing:
- 45 min editing photos in Lightroom
- 30 min creating social posts in Canva
- 25 min making a video
- 20 min building a property page
- Random time on email marketing

She was exhausted. And she could only take on 3-4 listings at a time because the marketing ate up all her hours.

Then she tried SnapR.

Now she processes the same listing in 15 minutes. Total.

She's taken on twice as many clients. Her stress level dropped. And she actually has evenings free again.

Here's her exact workflow:

## Email 4: Special Offer (Day 45)

**Subject Line:**
- A little something for you
- Wanted to make this easier

**Body:**

```
Hey {{first_name}},

I've been thinking about folks like you who tried SnapR but didn't convert.

So here's what I'm offering — just for past trial users:

**50% off your first 2 months**

That's $25/month instead of $49.

No catch. No commitment beyond those 2 months.

If it works for you, great. If not, cancel anytime.

[BUTTON: Claim 50% Off →]

Use code: COMEBACK50

This expires in 7 days, then I won't bring it up again.
