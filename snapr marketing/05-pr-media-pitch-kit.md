FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

SnapR Launches "Listing Operating System" to Replace Fragmented Real Estate Marketing Tools

New AI-powered platform takes listings from raw photos to market-ready in under 3 minutes, eliminating the need for 5-6 separate tools

[CITY, STATE] — [DATE] — SnapR, a new real estate technology company, today announced the launch of its comprehensive listing platform designed to replace the fragmented marketing tools real estate professionals currently rely on.

The platform combines AI-powered photo enhancement with content creation, video generation, property websites, and email marketing — all in a single integrated system that processes complete listings in under three minutes.

"Real estate professionals are drowning in tools," said Raj [Last Name], founder of SnapR. "They're paying for Lightroom, Canva, Hootsuite, video editors, website builders, and email platforms — spending $150-200 per month and 2-3 hours per listing just on marketing. We built SnapR to eliminate that entire workflow."

Key features of the SnapR platform include:

• AI Photo Enhancement: Automatically enhances listing photos with sky replacement, HDR processing, color correction, and virtual twilight conversion in approximately 30 seconds
• Content Studio: 150+ social media templates for Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn, and TikTok with AI-generated captions
• Video Creation: One-click video generation with professional transitions and music
• Property Websites: Automatically generated single-property websites
• Email Marketing: 24 professional templates optimized for real estate

Early users report saving an average of 2+ hours per listing compared to their previous workflows.

"I was spending over three hours on every listing just getting marketing materials ready," said Sarah M., a real estate photographer in Los Angeles. "With SnapR, I do the same work in 15 minutes. The quality is actually better because I'm not rushing through the tedious stuff."

SnapR is available immediately with a 14-day free trial. Pricing starts at $49/month for the Pro plan and $79/month for the Agency plan with team features.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

SnapR Processes 10,000 Listings in First 90 Days, Saves Users Over 20,000 Hours

Real estate marketing platform achieves rapid adoption as professionals seek workflow consolidation

[CITY, STATE] — [DATE] — SnapR, the all-in-one listing marketing platform, today announced it has processed over 10,000 real estate listings in its first 90 days of operation, representing an estimated savings of more than 20,000 hours for users.

The milestone highlights growing demand among real estate professionals for consolidated workflow solutions that eliminate the need for multiple disconnected tools.

"When we launched, we expected adoption from early adopters willing to try something new," said Raj [Last Name], founder of SnapR. "What surprised us was how quickly mainstream agents and photographers switched once they saw the time savings. We're averaging 2+ hours saved per listing."

Key metrics from SnapR's first 90 days:
• 10,000+ listings processed
• 250,000+ photos enhanced
• 20,000+ hours saved for users
• Average processing time: 2 minutes 47 seconds per listing
• User retention rate: [X]%

The platform has seen particularly strong adoption among real estate photographers, who represent the majority of current users, followed by individual agents and small teams.

"The before/after quality is what got me to try it, but the content creation is what made me stay," said Mike T., a real estate agent in Phoenix. "I canceled three other subscriptions after my first week on SnapR."

SnapR recently added [NEW FEATURE] and plans to launch [UPCOMING FEATURE] in the coming weeks based on user feedback.

# JOURNALIST PITCH TEMPLATES

## Pitch 1: Tech/Startup Publications (TechCrunch, The Verge)

**Subject:** New platform replaces 6 tools for real estate marketing — processing 10K listings

```
Hi [First Name],

Quick pitch for your consideration:

SnapR just crossed 10,000 listings processed in 90 days — and the story isn't the numbers, it's what it represents.

Real estate professionals have been stuck in a fragmented tool hell: Lightroom for editing, Canva for posts, Hootsuite for scheduling, separate tools for video, websites, email. $150-200/month, 2-3 hours per listing.

SnapR consolidates all of it into one AI-powered platform. Upload photos once, get everything market-ready in under 3 minutes.

The interesting angle: This is a case study in "tool consolidation" — the same trend we're seeing across creative industries as AI makes single-platform solutions viable.

Available for:
• Founder interview
• Product demo
• Data on workflow fragmentation costs
• User case studies

Let me know if this fits anything you're working on.

Thanks,
Raj
Founder, SnapR

## Pitch 2: Real Estate Trade Media (Inman, HousingWire)

**Subject:** EXCLUSIVE: How AI is (actually) changing listing marketing — data from 10K listings

```
Hi [First Name],

I've been reading your coverage of AI in real estate, and I wanted to offer a different angle: here's what the data actually shows.

At SnapR, we've processed 10,000+ listings in 90 days. Here's what we're seeing:

• Average time saved: 2+ hours per listing
• Most-used feature: AI photo enhancement, followed by social content creation
• Unexpected insight: [interesting data point]

The story: AI isn't replacing photographers or agents. It's eliminating the tedious work so they can focus on what matters.

I'd be happy to share:
• Our full dataset (anonymized)
• Interviews with power users
• Before/after workflow comparisons
• Exclusive first look at upcoming features

This could work as a trend piece on workflow consolidation, a product spotlight, or data journalism on how AI is actually being used (vs. the hype).

Let me know what angle interests you most.

Raj
Founder, SnapR

## Pitch 3: Photography Publications (Fstoppers, PetaPixel)

**Subject:** AI photo editing for real estate: honest results from 250K photos

```
Hey [First Name],

I've been a reader of [Publication] for years, so I'm reaching out directly rather than through PR channels.

I built SnapR — an AI platform that does real estate photo enhancement (sky replacement, HDR, twilight, the works). We've now processed 250,000+ photos, and I think the results are genuinely worth covering.

The pitch: This isn't "AI will replace photographers" — it's "AI handles the tedious edits so photographers can take on more clients."

What I can offer:
• Side-by-side comparisons: AI vs manual editing
• Performance data on what AI does well (and where it still struggles)
• Access to the platform for your own testing
• Honest conversation about the state of AI in photo editing

I'm not looking for a puff piece. If the AI sucks at something, say so. Your readers will appreciate the honesty, and it'll make us better.

Interested in taking a look?

Founder, SnapR (and longtime [Publication] reader)

## Pitch 4: Local Business/Startup Media

**Subject:** Local founder builds AI platform now used by 500+ real estate pros

```
Hi [First Name],

Local startup angle for you:

I'm Raj [Last Name], founder of SnapR, based in [CITY]. We just hit a milestone: 500+ real estate professionals are now using our platform to market their listings.

The story: I built the tool I wished existed when I was doing real estate marketing. What started as a side project is now processing 10,000+ listings and saving users thousands of hours.

Potential angles:
• Local founder, growing company
• The "workflow consolidation" trend in proptech
• How AI is creating new businesses, not just disrupting old ones

Available for interview at your convenience.

## Pitch 5: Podcast Booking

**Subject:** Podcast guest pitch: The hidden $200/month tax on real estate agents

```
Hi [Producer/Host Name],

Guest pitch for [Podcast Name]:

I'm Raj, founder of SnapR. I have a potentially interesting story about a hidden cost most real estate agents don't realize they're paying.

The hook: Real estate professionals spend $150-200/month on fragmented marketing tools (Lightroom + Canva + Hootsuite + video + email + websites). Most don't even realize it because the subscriptions pile up slowly.

I built a platform that replaces all of them for $49/month. In the process, I've learned a lot about:

• The "tool explosion" problem in creative industries
• How AI is enabling single-platform solutions
• What actually moves the needle in real estate marketing (vs. what's a waste of time)
• The founder journey of building something "boring" that people actually need

Format-wise, I'm flexible — happy to do full episode, quick segment, or whatever works for your show.

Previous podcast appearances: [list if applicable]

**Maker's First Comment:**
```
Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm Raj, founder of SnapR.

I built this because I was tired of the tool chaos in real estate marketing. Photo editing in one app, social posts in another, videos somewhere else, websites on a different platform...

It was expensive ($150-200/month) and time-consuming (2-3 hours per listing).

So I built what I wished existed: everything in one place.

The magic moment for most users is seeing their listing go from raw photos to completely market-ready (social posts, video, website, emails) in under 3 minutes.

Would love your feedback — what would make this more useful for you or anyone you know in real estate?
