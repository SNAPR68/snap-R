# OUTREACH TEMPLATES

## Template 1: YouTube RE Photography Influencer (Warm)

**Subject:** Collab idea for your {{subscriber_count}} subscribers

```
Hey {{first_name}},

I've been watching your content since {{specific_video_or_timeframe}} — your video on {{specific_video_title}} was especially helpful when I was {{specific_benefit_you_got}}.

I'm Raj, the founder of SnapR. We built what I'm calling the "complete listing platform" — basically Fotello + content creation + social publishing all in one place.

The pitch for your audience: real estate photographers upload their photos once, and get AI enhancement + social posts + videos + property websites + email campaigns. Everything market-ready in under 3 minutes.

What I'm proposing:

1. **Free lifetime access** — Use it however you want, no strings
2. **Sponsored review** — Honest take, keep whatever opinion you form
3. **Custom discount code** — 30% off for your audience (you get $20/signup)

I know you get a lot of pitches. Here's why this one might be worth your time:

- Nobody else is doing the "complete workflow" angle
- Your audience needs content creation tools, not just photo editing
- The before/after comparisons are genuinely impressive

Want me to set up a quick demo? Or I can just send login credentials and let you explore.

Either way, keep making great content.

## Template 2: Real Estate Coach/Podcast (Cold)

**Subject:** Guest pitch: The "tool explosion" problem costing agents $200/month

```
Hi {{first_name}},

Love what you're doing with {{podcast_name}} — especially the recent episode with {{recent_guest}} about {{topic}}.

Quick pitch for a potential episode:

I'm Raj, founder of SnapR. We built a platform that's replacing 5-6 tools for real estate professionals (Fotello + Canva + Hootsuite + video tools + email marketing → one platform).

**Topics I could cover:**
- The hidden cost of fragmented marketing tools ($200+/month most agents don't realize they're paying)
- How AI is changing listing marketing (what's real vs. hype)
- The workflow that takes listings from photos to market-ready in 3 minutes
- Why most agents waste 2+ hours per listing on marketing

**What I bring:**
- Founder story (built this to solve my own frustration)
- Actionable tactics (not just theory)
- Demo-ready examples (can show actual workflows)

I'm flexible on format — full episode, quick segment, whatever works for your show.

Interested?

## Template 3: Instagram/TikTok Micro-Influencer

**Subject:** Collab? Real estate content idea

```
Hey {{first_name}}!

Love your content, especially {{specific_post_or_style}}. Your audience seems really engaged.

I'm building SnapR — it's a platform that turns listing photos into social posts, videos, and marketing materials in like 2 minutes.

Would you be interested in:
- Free lifetime access (worth $600/year)
- $50 per post featuring the platform
- Custom affiliate link (20% commission on signups)

It's genuinely useful for your audience, and the before/after transformations make for great content.

Let me know if you want to see a quick demo!

## Template 4: Podcast Guest Booking

**Subject:** Guest pitch: How one platform replaced 6 tools for RE professionals

```
Hi {{producer_name}},

I'm reaching out about a potential guest spot on {{podcast_name}} for {{host_name}}.

**The Story:**
I'm Raj, founder of SnapR. I built a platform that's replacing the 5-6 disconnected tools real estate professionals currently use to market listings. The "aha moment" for most users is going from raw photos to completely market-ready (social posts, videos, property site, email campaign) in under 3 minutes.

**Why It's Relevant:**
- Every agent in your audience struggles with marketing time
- Tool fatigue is real ($200+/month on fragmented subscriptions)
- AI is transforming the industry — but most coverage is hype, not practical

**Potential Angles:**
1. "The tool consolidation trend" — why 2026 is the year of single-platform solutions
2. "3 minutes to market-ready" — the workflow I wish I had 5 years ago
3. "AI in real estate: what actually works" — separating hype from reality
4. Founder journey — building a SaaS in a "boring" industry

**My Background:**
- Founded SnapR after years in real estate marketing
- [Other relevant credentials]
- Comfortable on camera/mic, done previous podcasts [if applicable]

Happy to provide more info or do a quick pre-call if helpful.

Thanks for considering!

## Template 5: Follow-Up (No Response After 5-7 Days)

**Subject:** Re: {{original_subject}} (quick follow-up)

```
Hey {{first_name}},

Just bumping this in case it got buried — I know inboxes are chaos.

Quick recap: I'm offering free lifetime access to SnapR (complete listing platform) + sponsored review opportunity for your channel.

If you're not interested, no worries at all — just let me know and I won't follow up again.

If you are interested but timing's off, happy to circle back whenever works better.

— Raj
```

## Template 6: Breakup Email (No Response After 2 Follow-Ups)

**Subject:** Closing the loop

```
Hey {{first_name}},

I've reached out a couple times about SnapR and haven't heard back — totally get it, you're busy.

I'll assume this isn't a fit right now and won't email again.

But if things ever change, the offer stands: free lifetime access + sponsorship opportunity whenever you want it.

Keep making great content.

— Raj

# MEDIA KIT ELEMENTS

## About SnapR (Boilerplate)

**Short (50 words):**
SnapR is the complete listing platform for real estate professionals. Our AI-powered system takes listings from raw photos to market-ready in under 3 minutes — replacing photo editing, content creation, video generation, property websites, and email marketing with a single integrated platform.

**Medium (100 words):**
SnapR is transforming how real estate professionals market their listings. Instead of juggling 5-6 separate tools (Lightroom, Canva, Hootsuite, video editors, website builders, email platforms), SnapR provides a single integrated platform that handles everything. Upload photos, and in under 3 minutes you have: AI-enhanced images, social media posts with captions, video content, a property website, and email campaigns ready to send. Founded by Raj [Last Name], SnapR is positioned as the "Listing Operating System" — the all-in-one solution that eliminates tool fatigue and saves professionals 2+ hours per listing.

**Long (200 words):**
SnapR is redefining real estate marketing by combining AI-powered photo enhancement with comprehensive content creation in a single, intuitive platform.

Real estate professionals currently spend 2-3 hours per listing just on marketing tasks: editing photos, creating social media posts, generating videos, building property websites, and crafting email campaigns. This requires 5-6 different tools, each with its own subscription, learning curve, and workflow.

SnapR eliminates this fragmentation. With one upload, users receive:
- AI-enhanced photos in 30 seconds (sky replacement, HDR, color correction)
- 150+ social media templates with AI-generated captions
- Automated video creation with transitions and music
- Instant property websites
- Professional email campaign templates

The result? Listings go from raw photos to completely market-ready in under 3 minutes.

Founded by Raj [Last Name], SnapR is built specifically for real estate photographers, agents, teams, and brokerages who want to reclaim their time without sacrificing quality. The platform positions itself as the "Listing Operating System" — not just another photo editor, but the complete workflow solution the industry has been waiting for.

## Key Statistics (Update as available)

- Time saved per listing: 2+ hours
- Photo enhancement speed: 30 seconds for 25 photos
- Social templates: 150+
- Email templates: 24
- Complete workflow time: Under 3 minutes
