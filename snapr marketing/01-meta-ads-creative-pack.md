I love Fotello for photo editing. It's fast and the quality is great.

But here's the thing — after I edit my photos, I still need to:
→ Create social posts (Canva)
→ Schedule them (Hootsuite)
→ Make a video (InVideo)
→ Build a property site (Squarespace)
→ Write emails (Mailchimp)

That's 5 more tools. 5 more subscriptions. 5 more logins.

SnapR does ALL of it. One platform. One price.

Photo editing + content creation + publishing.

Try it free — no credit card required.

Here's what AI photo editors don't tell you:

Photo editing is only 20% of listing marketing.

After the edit, you still need:
• Social media posts (design + captions)
• Video content for Reels/TikTok
• A property website
• Email campaigns
• Scheduling and publishing

That's 80% of the work still waiting.

SnapR doesn't just edit your photos.
It takes them all the way to market-ready.

One upload. Everything created. Published everywhere.

That's 100% of the problem, solved.
