We've been building SnapR in stealth for the past year.

Today, we're finally ready to show you what we've made.

SnapR is the complete listing platform — everything you need to take a listing from raw photos to completely market-ready in under 3 minutes.

No more juggling 6 different apps.
No more $200/month in subscriptions.
No more 2-hour marketing sessions per listing.

Just upload → enhance → create → publish.

Try it free. Link in bio.

### LinkedIn (Founder Post)
```
I'm excited to announce: SnapR is live.

For the past year, I've been building the platform I wished existed when I was doing real estate marketing.

The problem I was solving: Real estate professionals spend 2-3 hours per listing just on marketing. And they need 5-6 different tools to do it.

Photo editing in Lightroom.
Social posts in Canva.
Scheduling in Hootsuite.
Videos in another app.
Property websites somewhere else.
Email campaigns in yet another platform.

It's exhausting. And expensive.

SnapR changes that.

One upload. Everything created. Under 3 minutes.

We're calling it the "Listing Operating System" — because it's not just another photo editor. It's the complete workflow.

If you're in real estate, I'd love for you to try it and tell me what you think.

## Day 2 (Tuesday) — DEMO VIDEO

### Instagram Reel
**Script (30 seconds):**
```
[0-3s] Hook: "Watch me turn 25 raw photos into a complete marketing package"

[3-8s] Show: Uploading photos to SnapR

[8-13s] Show: AI enhancement processing (speed up)

[13-18s] Show: Before/after comparison

[18-23s] Show: Content Studio — social post created

[23-28s] Show: Timer showing "2:47"

[28-30s] Text: "From photos to market-ready. Under 3 minutes."
```

**Caption:**
```
2 minutes 47 seconds.

That's how long it took to:
✓ Enhance 25 photos
✓ Create an Instagram post
✓ Generate a video
✓ Build a property website

This used to take me 2+ hours.

Full demo in bio link.

#RealEstatePhotography #ListingMarketing #AIPhotoEditing
```

### LinkedIn
```
I just recorded my entire listing workflow.

Start to finish: 2 minutes 47 seconds.

Here's what happened in that time:
• 25 photos enhanced by AI
• Instagram post created (caption included)
• Property video generated
• Website built and live
• Email campaign ready to send

This same process used to take me over 2 hours.

The future of real estate marketing isn't "faster photo editing."

It's eliminating the entire fragmented workflow.

That's what we built with SnapR.

## Day 3 (Wednesday) — EDUCATION

### Instagram Carousel
**Title:** "5 Photos Every Listing Needs (And Most Miss)"

**Slide 1:**
```
5 Photos Every Listing Needs
(And Most Agents Miss #4)
```

**Slide 2:**
```
1. THE HERO SHOT

Wide exterior showing the whole property.
Best time: Golden hour or twilight.
This is your thumbnail everywhere.
```

**Slide 3:**
```
2. THE KITCHEN MONEY SHOT

Kitchens sell houses.
Shoot from the corner.
Show counters, cabinets, and appliances.
```

**Slide 4:**
```
3. THE LIFESTYLE SHOT

People buy emotions, not rooms.
Show the backyard with the firepit lit.
The patio ready for entertaining.
```

**Slide 5:**
```
4. THE NEIGHBORHOOD CONTEXT
(Most agents miss this)

Nearby park. Walking distance to coffee.
The cute street view.
Buyers want to imagine the lifestyle.
```

**Slide 6:**
```
5. THE DETAIL SHOT

Custom tile work. The fancy doorknob.
Built-in wine fridge.
Details justify the price point.
```

**Slide 7:**
```
Pro tip: Let AI pick your hero shot.

SnapR's Listing Intelligence analyzes
all your photos and recommends
which one performs best.

Try free: link in bio
```

**Caption:**
```
Most listings miss at least one of these.

The hero shot gets all the attention. But #4 — the neighborhood context shot — is what makes buyers actually reach out.

People don't just buy houses. They buy neighborhoods. They buy the coffee shop down the street. The park their kids will play in.

Show them that.

Save this for your next listing 📌

## Day 4 (Thursday) — BEHIND THE SCENES

### Instagram Story (Multi-slide)

**Slide 1:**
```
[Photo of workspace/screen]
"Building new features today 👀"
```

```
[Screenshot of feature in progress]

```

### LinkedIn (Founder)
```
Startup life update:

This week we shipped 3 new features, fixed 47 bugs, and onboarded our 100th user.

The feature I'm most excited about: [specific feature].

Here's why it matters: [explanation].

The hardest part of building a startup isn't the code. It's deciding what NOT to build.

Every day, users request features. Some are brilliant. Some would take us in the wrong direction.

The skill I'm developing: saying "not yet" instead of "no."

"Not yet" means we hear you. It's on the list. We'll get there.

"No" shuts down the conversation.

What's your strategy for managing feature requests?
```

## Day 5 (Friday) — SOCIAL PROOF

### Instagram Feed
**Type:** Single Image (Testimonial graphic)

**Visual:**
```
[Dark background, gold accent]

"SnapR cut my listing prep
from 3 hours to 15 minutes.

I can't imagine going back."

— Sarah M.
Real Estate Photographer
Los Angeles, CA

[5 gold stars]
```

**Caption:**
```
Sarah was spending 3+ hours on every listing.

Photo editing. Social posts. Videos. Emails.

Now she does it all in 15 minutes.

She's taken on twice as many clients this year.

What would you do with an extra 2-3 hours per listing?

#RealEstatePhotography #Testimonial #WorkflowWins
```

### LinkedIn
```
One of our users, Sarah, shared her experience with SnapR this week.

Before: 3+ hours per listing on marketing
After: 15 minutes per listing

She's now taking on twice as many clients.

The best part? She said the quality is actually BETTER than when she did everything manually.

Here's what she told me: "I used to spend so much time on the tedious stuff that I'd rush the creative decisions. Now the AI handles the tedious stuff, and I can focus on the strategy."

That's exactly what we built SnapR for.

Not to replace photographers or agents.

To free them up to do the work that actually matters.

## Day 10 (Wednesday) — COMPARISON

### LinkedIn
```
Real talk: Here's what I actually spend on marketing tools each month.

BEFORE SNAPR:
- Lightroom: $10/mo
- Canva Pro: $13/mo
- Hootsuite: $99/mo
- InVideo: $25/mo
- Mailchimp: $13/mo
- Squarespace: $16/mo

Total: $176/month

AFTER SNAPR:
- SnapR Pro: $49/mo

Savings: $127/month ($1,524/year)

Plus the time savings: ~2 hours per listing.

At 10 listings/month, that's 20 hours saved.

At even $50/hour, that's another $1,000/month in value.

I'm not saying this to pitch you.

I'm saying this because I spent years paying for fragmented tools before realizing there was a better way.

What tools are you using? Curious what others are spending.
